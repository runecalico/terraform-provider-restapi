## Fixed
- Fix a bug causing crash any time the provider is configured with `oauth_client_credentials`. Thanks for the report in #162, @AndreasSko!

## Broken
- An apparent terraform bug was detected while triaging #162. The `endpoint_params` sub map of `oauth_client_credentials` does not work. It is unclear if this ever functioned.
