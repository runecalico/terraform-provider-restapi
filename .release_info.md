## Fixed
- Fix handling of server-deletes resulting in 404s. Thanks for the fix in #156, @NicoK!

## New
- Add ability to accept TLS cert/key as a string in addition to as files. Thanks for PR #172, @douernesto!

## Misc
- Upgrade the provider to move away from legacy terraform core to the newer terraform-plugin-sdk v2. Note - this forces those building the provider to have golang 1.17 or newer toolkit
- Resolve a few security vulnerabilities in dependencies by upgrading to latest versions
